# Clean Architecture
A software design philosophy introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) that emphasizes the separation of concerns, maintainability, and independence from external frameworks and technologies. It is a way to structure software so that it is easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain over time.

## What's the importance of each layer:

- **Entities:**
  Represent business logic and rules. They encapsulate general rules and are independent of other parts.
- **Use Cases:**
  Apply business logic to specific tasks and manage interactions between entities and external layers.
- **Interface Adapters:**
  Convert data between internal business logic and external systems like databases and UI, keeping logic clean.
- **Frameworks and Drivers:**
  Contain code for external dependencies and infrastructure, such as web frameworks and databases. This layer is the most changeable and should be isolated from core logic.

## Why is structure and architecture needed:

They provide clear separation of concerns, making complexity management easier, improving testability and maintainability, and allowing easier scaling and modification with minimal impact on other parts.

## Other architecture types, pros and cons:

### 1. **Monolithic Architecture:**
  
➕ Simple development and deployment, unified management.

➖ Scaling difficulties, complexity in adopting new technologies.

### 2. **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture:**
  
➕ Clear separation, ease of maintenance.

➖ Performance overhead, rigid structure.

### 3. **Microservices Architecture:**
  
➕ Independent services, better fault isolation.

➖ Management complexity, communication overhead.

### 4. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**

➕ Reusability, ease of integration.

➖ Complexity with many services, contract maintenance.

### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
  
➕ Flexibility, scalability, real-time processing.

➖ Debugging difficulty, managing asynchronous events.

- **Hexagonal Architecture:**
  
➕ Strong separation of business logic and external systems, easy testing.

➖ Overkill for simple apps, requires careful planning.
