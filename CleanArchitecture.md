# Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) that emphasizes the separation of concerns, maintainability, and independence from external frameworks and technologies. It is a way to structure software so that it is easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain over time.

Clean Architecture is a layered architecture that organizes code into a set of concentric circles, each representing different layers of the application. These layers include entities, use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks/drivers.


## What's the importance of each layer:

The core idea is that the inner layers should be independent of the outer layers, making the system more modular and easier to test.

- **Entities:**
  Represent business logic and rules. They encapsulate general rules and are independent of other parts.
- **Use Cases:**
  Apply business logic to specific tasks and manage interactions between entities and external layers.
- **Interface Adapters:**
  Convert data between internal business logic and external systems like databases and UI, keeping logic clean.
- **Frameworks and Drivers:**
  Contain code for external dependencies and infrastructure, such as web frameworks and databases. This layer is the most changeable and should be isolated from core logic.


To better understand Clean Architecture, let’s look at the corresponding diagram:

In this diagram, the entities are the core business objects that define the essential properties and behaviors. The Application Core encapsulate the application-specific business logic, defining what the application should do. The infrastructure handle the interaction between the use cases and the external world, such as web requests and database access. Finally, the User interface layer includes the actual implementation of the web framework, database, and other external dependencies.


## Why is structure and architecture needed:

They provide clear separation of concerns, making complexity management easier, improving testability and maintainability, and allowing easier scaling and modification with minimal impact on other parts.

## Other architecture types, pros and cons:

**1. **Monolithic Architecture:****
  
➕ Simple development and deployment, unified management.

➖ Scaling difficulties, complexity in adopting new technologies.

**2. **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture:****
  
➕ Clear separation, ease of maintenance.

➖ Performance overhead, rigid structure.

**3. **Microservices Architecture:****
  
➕ Independent services, better fault isolation.

➖ Management complexity, communication overhead.

**4. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):****

➕ Reusability, ease of integration.

➖ Complexity with many services, contract maintenance.

**5. **Event-Driven Architecture:****
  
➕ Flexibility, scalability, real-time processing.

➖ Debugging difficulty, managing asynchronous events.

**6. **Hexagonal Architecture:****
  
➕ Strong separation of business logic and external systems, easy testing.

➖ Overkill for simple apps, requires careful planning.
