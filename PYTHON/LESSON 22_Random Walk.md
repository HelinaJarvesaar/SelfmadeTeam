2. What is a Random Walk?
https://youtu.be/stgYW6M5o4k

Simulate a 1D simple random walk where at each step can be moving only up or down. 

How many steps ‚è´  can you actually get?


```py
import random

steps = 1000
steps_up = 0
location = 0
locations = [location]

for i in range (steps):
  step = random.choice([-1,1])
  location += step
  locations.append(location)

  if step == 1:
    steps_up += 1

print(f"Location after {steps} steps: {location}")
print(f"Number of steps-up: {steps_up}")
```

pylab.show()
